                    <p>Land, air and sea. Vehicles seem to be everywhere and anywhere. We seem to take our surroundings for granted but never thoroughly thought how such machines came to be and how they benefit society so much. I wondered how these vehicles ever worked in the first place. As a person whose interests lie in this field, I'd like more people to know about these machines and how useful they are.</p>

                    <h2>Brief Summary</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom:10px">With my proficiency in Solidworks, AutoCAD, and other design tools, in addition to interpreting geometric and numeric constraints in technical drawings make me very capable when designing and communicating technical concepts and ideas.</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom:10px">I have more than a few hours of materials testing experience. Testing using Rockwell and Vickers Hardness tests, the effect of various treatments of ferrous alloys, as well as properties of polymer and composite materials, help me choose the right material for the right job.</p>

                    <p>My knowledge in both mechanical design and material properties will help aid my future ambitions in motive power, transportation technologies, and the heavy industries.</p>
