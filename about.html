<h1> Ambitions </h1>
<div id=about>
	<p> My goals in the future are to take on a master's in either mechanical or manufacturing engineering. Afterwards, I want to work for an automotive company such as Tesla, a traditional automotive company such as Toyota or Audi, and then, in heavy industries such as Mitsubishi or Hyundai. I want to specialize in powertrain design and manufacturing in most of these companies. </p>

	<p> I want to pursue a masters in engineering since I want to further my studies in the specific techniques in power generation and transfer in engines. It will let me receive a deeper understanding of the operating principles of the heart of the machine. The understanding of the manufacturing processes of such machines would let me choose the right materials whether it be ceramics, metals, or composite materials. </p>

	<p> Later on, I want to work for a company such as Tesla. Their interests in electric powered vehicles are very interesting and their continuing growth and their advancements and endeavours into the field of electric motors continue to be on top. I hope to gain significant knowledge of electric powertrains and how to implement efficiently and effectively into vehicles. I also want to work in companies such as Toyota, where they have a long history of making civilian automobiles but also industrial transportation vehicles. They are a leader in hybrid technology where they both implement traditional internal combustion engines and electric power into their vehicles. I'd say this is a good compromise between the two technologies. Through my time in the company, I would gain significant technical knowledge of both methods. However, I want to improve these technologies and not just make it a compromise but attain the best of both worlds. </p>

	<p> After gaining substantial knowledge in the different types of power production and how to each can work together, I may transition to work in heavy industries such as Mitsubishi and Hyundai. I want to design and build powertrains for larger vehicles such as ships and trains. These systems are much more advanced and larger in scale than commercial and civilian automobiles. I want to challenge myself in the future to learn how such a complicated system works together. This would be the ultimate challenge in my prospective career. As well, these systems tend to use traditional internal combustion engine systems to propel themselves. I would want to implement the new electric propulsion technologies to make them more efficient and effective. </p>
