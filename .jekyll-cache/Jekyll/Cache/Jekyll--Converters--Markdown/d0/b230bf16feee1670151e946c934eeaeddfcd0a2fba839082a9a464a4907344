# Introduction
It can be noted that the acceleration of an object is the sum of all the forces acting upon it by Newton's Second Law. 

$$ \vect{F}_{Net} = \Sigma\vect{F} = m\vect{a(t)} = m\differtiate{\vect{v(t)}}{t} $$

Notice that we can write this equation in either with velocity and position as well.

$$ \Sigma\vect{F} = m\vect{a(t)} = m\differtiate{\vect{v(t)}}{t} = m\: \dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2}{\mathrm{dt^2}}{(\vect{s(t)})} $$

The key here is to notice that acceleration is the derivative of velocity and position is the integral of velocity with respect to time.
We can split this net force into components in the x and y coordinates and by extension, the z coordinates.
\begin{align}
    \Sigma\vect{F} &amp;= \overbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \Sigma F_x \\ \Sigma F_y \end{pmatrix}}^{\mathbb{R}^2} &amp;
    \Sigma\vect{F} &amp;= \overbrace{\begin{pmatrix} \Sigma F_x \\ \Sigma F_y \\ \Sigma F_z \end{pmatrix}}^{\mathbb{R}^3}    
\end{align}

Of course, all these are defined for time greater than 0.
