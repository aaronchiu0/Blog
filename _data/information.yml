introduction:
  Land, air and sea. Vehicles are everywhere. We take our surroundings for granted but never thoroughly think about how such machines came to be and how they benefited society. I wondered how these vehicles ever worked in the first place. My interest in this field drives me to discover and teach more people about the technologies’ effectiveness and impact.
summary:
  - With my proficiency in Solidworks, AutoCAD, CATIA, and ANSYS, in addition to interpreting geometric and numeric constraints in technical drawings, give me the necessary skills for designing and communicating technical engineering concepts and ideas.
  - I have more than 40 hours of materials testing experience such as Rockwell and Vickers Hardness tests, I know various treatments and their effects on ferrous and non-ferrous alloys, properties of polymers, and composite materials. This knowledge helps me choose the right material for the job.
  - My knowledge in both mechanical design and material properties will aid my ambitions in motive power, transportation technologies, and the heavy industries.
