<h1>Distribution of X Number of Successes</h1>

    <h1>A Bit of Theory</h1>
    <h2>Chance of Independent Events</h2>
    <h3>At Least One Success</h3>
    <p>
        We can think of this as the opposite of losing every time. In other words the complementary.

        $$ P = 1 - (1-p)^n \qquad \begin{cases} P: &\text{Probability} \\ p: &\text{Probability of Success} \\ n: &\text{Number of Trials} \end{cases} $$ 
    </p>

    <h3>At Least X Number of Successes (General Case)</h3>
    <p>
        Similarily, we can think of this as the opposite of losing every time, plus all the times we have lost. For example, if we want at least two successes, it is the complement of losing every time, as well as getting only one success. These situations follow the Binomial Distribution. <br>

        The probability of getting exactly $X$ number of successes is as follows: 

        $$ P(X=k) = {\binom n k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$$

        ${\binom n k}$ is the Binomial Coeffeicent more often known as $_nC_k$. <br>
        This can be computed as: <br>

        $$ {\binom n k} = {\frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}} = {\prod _{i=1}^{k}{\frac {n+1-i}{i}}} $$

        The latter being computationally more efficient. <br>
        We aren't here to calculate a certain probablity at a certain number of successes but to total or cummulative probablity. This can be given by adding up the probabilities.

        $$ P(X\leq k)=\sum _{i=0}^{k}{n \choose i}p^{i}(1-p)^{n-i}$$ 

        This will calculate the probablilty of X number of successes or less. To get at least X or more successes, it is as follows:

        $$ P(X\geq k)=1-\sum _{i=0}^{k-1}{n \choose i}p^{i}(1-p)^{n-i} $$ 
    </p>

    <h2>Required Trials</h2>
    <h3>At Least One Successes</h3>
    <p>
        Through what we have in the previous section, we can easily derive the number of trials it takes to reach a certain probability.

        $$ n > \frac{\ln{(1-P)}}{\ln{(1-p)}} \qquad \begin{cases} P: &\text{Required Probability} \\ p: &\text{Probability of Success} \end{cases} $$ 
    </p>

    <h3>At Least X Number of Successes (General Case)</h3>
    <p>
        We can formulate the same idea as with at least one case.

        $$ P > 1-\sum _{i=0}^{k-1}{n \choose i}p^{i}(1-p)^{n-i} $$

        Simply solve for $n$ and we have our number of trials. <br>
        Of courses, as you can see it isn't very simple, and so we will employ some help from the computer and solve this numerically. Mainly using Newton-Raphson's Method to finding what $n$ should be.
