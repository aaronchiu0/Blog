<h3>Proving a Solution of a Differential Equation</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Find all derivatives needed from the solution according to the differential equation</li>
    <li>Substitute the derivitves into the differtial equation</li>
    <li>If the result is zero, then the solution is an actual solution. If it is not, it is not a solution</li>
</ol>

    <summary>Example of Proving a solution to Differential Equation</summary>
    <p>
        Show that the given function $y = Ce^{5x}$ is a solution of $y'-5y=0$ where $C$ is constant. Find $C$ if $y(0)=2$. <br>
        We will have to find the solution's derivative and substitute it into the differential equation.
        
        $$\begin{aligned}
            y &= Ce^{5x} &  y'-5y &= 0 \\
            y' &= 5Ce^{5x} & 5Ce^{5x} - 5Ce^{5x} &= 0 \\
            & & 0 &= 0
        \end{aligned}$$
        
        We have to next find what $C$ is by substituting the initial bounds.
        
        $$\begin{aligned}
            y(0) &= 2 \\
            Ce^{5(0)} &= 2 \\
            C &= 2
        \end{aligned}$$

    <summary>Example of Mathematical Model</summary>
    <p>
        The acceration of a car is proportianlto the difference between 250 km/h and the velocity of the car. <br>
        The resulting mathematical model would be: $$\frac{dv}{dt}=k(250-v)$$
        Remembering to add the constant $k$ is essential.
